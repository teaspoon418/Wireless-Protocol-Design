# Wireless-Protocol-Design

300 random nodes given in an area of 10,000*10,000. For these randomly created nodes, the aim is to group these nodes in different clusters. All of these clusters should have a cluster head which should have an intra- or inter- cluster communication to maintain connectivity in a network.The system design must be power efficient where the all the nodes consume minimal power while ensuring full connectivity.
