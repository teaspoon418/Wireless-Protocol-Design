# Wireless-Protocol-Design

The aim is to design a routing algorithm for the given cluster tree mesh where network nodes communicates with each other using the shortest possible path between them. The network originates from a root node (gateway) which is also a cluster head for network 1. The protocol design should cover all aspects of network - contention, channel utilization, MAC implementation, frequency allocations in 802.15.4, synchronisation of nodes, how routing tables will be implemented, and how GUID will be resolved to dynamic addresses.
